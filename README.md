<h1>Behind the Scenes</h1>
<h3>How "Are Income and Crime Related" was made</h3>
I got the data for the story at https://maps.nyc.gov/crime/ and http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/dis/census/Features/tract2zip/
<br>
On the crime map, I looked through the data to find the 15 neighborhoods with highest crime rates, then cleaned up the data and put it into an Excel spreadsheet.<br>
For the census data, it took a bit longer. I had to find these 15 neighborhoods, clean up the data, and erase everything that wasn't the median income.
<br> Then, I put the two data sets on one excel spreadsheet. 
<br> Next, I went to datawrapper.de in order to make the charts. 
<br> I made two different charts in order to make them easier to read.
<br> I chose bar graphs because I felt it displayed the information in the most clear, easy to read way.
<br> Finally, I put the text and charts together on github!
<br> There were no big problems, it just was tedious cleaning up the data, but it worked out in the end!
